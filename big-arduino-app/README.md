Big Arduino is an early-stage project exploring how visualization and AI co-creation can make working with Arduino simpler and more approachable, especially for beginners and non-technical users.

Instead of starting from code and complex wiring, this project focuses on:

Visualizing Arduino components, pins, and connections

Interacting with circuits directly in a workspace

Using AI as a co-creation partner to assist understanding, setup, and experimentation

The project is still in a very early phase. Many features are experimental, incomplete, or subject to change. The current goal is to prototype core interactions and workflows, rather than deliver a finished product.

This repository represents an ongoing exploration of how visual tools and AI can lower the barrier to physical computing and hardware prototyping with Arduino.
